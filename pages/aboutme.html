                    <p>
                        We have an art first mentality. We try to create
                        things that people can enjoy and be moved by. Our
                        creativity and imaginiation are our values we hold
                        most dear. It is because of this that we believe in
                        the process, and will never use any sort of generative
                        AI tools to replace the creative process.

                        Mods are what keep our games alive. Our game engine
                        and titles will always support modding and tinkering. 
                        It is because of this that we will never release our game
                        with software that stops modification. Mod it till it breaks!

                        Money is something required to keep our studio running. By
                        purchasing a game you are directly supporting us.
                        However money can also cause problems in games. We believe that
                        real world and in game items should be seprate. And that a fantasy
                        stops being a fantasy when you need to pay for it in the real world.
                        No microtransactions, no crypto, no NFTs, and NO predatory
                        marketing practices.

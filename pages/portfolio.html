                    <p>
                        This was a poster I made with a group of people in order to illustrate
                        the positive and negaitive aspects media has on people's self image. The poster
                        describes and illustrates the negative effects body image in media can have such
                        as low self esteem. The positive effects such as a motivation to be healthier, and
                        howto fight body shaming and negativity.
